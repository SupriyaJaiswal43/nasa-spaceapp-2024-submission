## A Brief of the Prototype:
  VaranasiHydrotrack: Community Water Quality Mapping:
Problem Definition:
‚û¢ Communities lack accessible tools to monitor, visualize, and share water quality data, making it difficult to identify and address water pollution issues
effectively.
Brief about the idea:
Solution:
‚û¢ A comprehensive web-based platform that enables:
‚û¢ Real-time water quality data collection and visualization.
‚û¢ Community-driven pollution reporting.
‚û¢ Interactive mapping of water quality metrics.
‚û¢ Data-driven insights for environmental decision-making.
Impact:
‚û¢ Empowers citizens to actively participate in water quality monitoring.
‚û¢ Facilitates data-driven environmental policy decisions.
‚û¢ Creates a transparent, community-led approach to water management.
‚û¢ Supports the UN's Sustainable Development Goal 6: Clean Water and Sanitation.
Target Users:
‚û¢ Local community members.
‚û¢ Environmental scientists and researchers.
‚û¢ Policy makers and government officials.
‚û¢ Environmental protection agencies.


üöÄ Features

Geocoding Functionality: Converts user-provided addresses into geographic coordinates using the Nominatim service from OpenStreetMap. Water Quality Data Integration: Users can submit water quality data (pH, turbidity, contaminant levels, etc.) via a user-friendly form. Interactive Map: Visualizes water quality data on a map with clustering techniques to avoid clutter and provide insights into regional trends. Pollution Reporting: Users can report water quality pollution incidents directly on the map by selecting the location. Data Visualization: Display water quality trends over time using charts powered by Chart.js. Document Submission: Upload and store documents related to water quality incidents. üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript Backend: Node.js, Express.js Database: MongoDB (Spatial indexing for quick location-based queries) Geospatial Mapping: OpenStreetMap, Nominatim API, Leaflet.js Data Visualization: Chart.js üìã Project Setup
